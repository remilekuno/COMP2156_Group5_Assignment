Importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle.

Learning DevOps is vital in the software development cycle as it fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, 
resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery. By automating repetitive tasks, implementing continuous integration and deployment 
(CI/CD), and emphasizing early testing, DevOps accelerates the development process and improves the quality of software. Additionally, 
DevOps practices help scale applications efficiently, enhance security through proactive measures, and ensure quick recovery from failures. 
This approach streamlines workflows, reduces manual errors, and ultimately leads to more resilient and cost-effective

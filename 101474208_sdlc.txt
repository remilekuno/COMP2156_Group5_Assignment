The Importance of Learning DevOps in the Software Development Cycle

Learning DevOps is essential in the software development cycle as it promotes seamless 
collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to faster and more reliable software delivery. 
By automating repetitive tasks, implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and prioritizing early testing, 
DevOps accelerates development while enhancing software quality.

Additionally, DevOps practices enable efficient application scaling, strengthen security through proactive measures, 
and ensure rapid recovery from failures. This approach streamlines workflows, minimizes manual errors, and ultimately 
results in more resilient and cost-effective software development.

A DevOps course focuses on integrating software development (Dev) and 
IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration, automation, and efficiency 
in the software delivery process. It covers key concepts like continuous 
integration and deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), 
containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud computing, monitoring, 
and security. Students learn tools such as Git, Jenkins, Ansible, 
Terraform, and AWS. The course emphasizes automation, scalability, 
and faster release cycles. With hands-on labs and real-world projects, 
learners develop practical skills to streamline workflows, improve system 
reliability, and enhance deployment efficiency, making them valuable assets 
in modern software engineering and IT operations.

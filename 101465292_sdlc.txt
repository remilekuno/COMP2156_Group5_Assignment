The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process
 used in software engineering to design, develop, test, and deploy
  software efficiently. It consists of key phases: planning, 
  requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, 
  and maintenance. SDLC ensures software meets business and user 
  needs while minimizing risks and costs. Common models include 
  Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and DevOps. Each phase has specific 
  tasks, from defining project goals to coding and debugging, 
  ensuring high-quality software. By following SDLC, teams enhance 
  productivity, improve collaboration, and deliver reliable software 
  solutions that align with industry standards and best practices.
